# Bouncing Ball

The "Bouncing Ball" project is a Java application developed using the JavaFX framework. It provides an interactive and visually appealing simulation of bouncing balls within a resizable pane. 

## Features

- **Resizable Pane:** The application's user interface is built using a resizable pane, which allows the user to adjust the size of the window according to their preferences.

- **Add and Remove Balls:** The pane includes buttons to add and subtract balls dynamically. When the "Add" button is clicked, a new ball is added to the pane, and when the "Subtract" button is clicked, a ball is removed from the pane.

- **Bouncing Ball Animation:** The balls in the pane are animated to simulate realistic bouncing behavior. The animation is embedded within the pane, ensuring that the balls move and change their direction when the walls/boundaries are reached.

- **Speed Control:** A scrollbar is provided at the top of the pane to control the speed of the balls. The user can adjust the speed using the scrollbar, allowing for customization and experimentation with different ball movement velocities.

## Description

The "Bouncing Ball" project offers a fun and interactive way to explore the concepts of animation and simulation. By leveraging the JavaFX framework, the application provides a rich graphical interface that allows users to observe and interact with bouncing balls.

The resizable pane provides a flexible canvas for the balls to move around, adapting to different window sizes. The "Add" and "Subtract" buttons enable dynamic ball manipulation, empowering users to control the number of balls present in the simulation.

The animation logic incorporated within the pane ensures that the balls exhibit realistic bouncing behavior, adding a touch of realism to the simulation. Users can experiment with different speeds by adjusting the scrollbar, influencing the velocity of the ball movement, the bouncing balls can be freezed/paused via the click and hold action on the pane and it can be resumed on release of the click.
